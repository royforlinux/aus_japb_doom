## AUS PB4 Doom
It's Doom for the AUS clone of the Pandora's Box 4  what elese did you expect?


## Introduction
This is a port of [LSDLDOOM](http://jesshaas.com/lsdldoom/) by Jess Haas.  It comes with the Shareware version of Doom.

It can also play Doom II, Ultimate Doom & Final Doom, just add the WAD files into the /games directory.

This was mostly done just to prove it could be done, and to get a better understanding of the Hardware so I could build something more interesting.

If there is genuine interest I could work on it some more, the load/save game does not currently work, and the button remapping is still a bit hit and miss.


## Installation Instructions
you will need an 8Gb SD card, Class 10 is best not not essential.  Download/unzip the latest release and burn/write it in the usual way.


## Controls
The controls can be remapped (to a degree) but

Joy Stick - Movement

Button1   - Fire

Button2   - Strafe

Button3   - Run

Button4   - Use

P1 Start - Menu


## Compatible Hardware
The AUS clone of the Pandora's Box 4 is a very popular Jamma arcade board on sites like AliExpress.  There are several different versions of the product re-packaged under different names.

It is often referred to as ‘Just another Pandora’s Box’, and sold under the names Pandora’s Box 4/4s/4X, King of Air, Heroes of the Storm 3 & Little Elf 3X.  The number of built in Games will vary between 654 and 800.  If you are looking to purchase one look for a listing with the picture of the case and ensure it has the AUS logo on it.  Check with the seller that is a ‘genuine AUS’ version.

The hardware is all fairly similar, however this version has only been tested as working on the 87 and the 92C version.
